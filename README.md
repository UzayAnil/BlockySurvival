A work-in-progress Minecraft clone. 

Disclaimer: As mentioned above, this is a work-in-progress. It has many bugs and missing features.

Controls should be more-or-less the same as actual Minecraft.

Libraries:
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [NoiseJS](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
