# Minecraft.js
A work-in-progress Minecraft clone. 

Disclaimer: As mentioned above, this is a work-in-progress. It has many bugs and missing features.

Controls should be more-or-less the same as actual Minecraft.

Libraries:
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [NoiseJS](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)

Please follow the these instructions in order to execute the game,

Move all the files outside of the Minecraft.js folder to that folder

And that is it

You might wonder why couldn't I do that in the repository, well it was because I have gotten a glitch when I wanted to upload files into the Minecraft.js folder and didn't allow me to put files there.
